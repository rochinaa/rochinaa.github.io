<h1>Installing RDS updates with &laquo;RdsUnpack.exe&raquo;</h1>

<p>Installing RDS updates with &laquo;<span class="file">RdsUnpack.exe</span>&raquo; is possible
<span class="emph">only if</span> RDS is installed into the
&laquo;<span class="file">My Documents</span>&raquo; folder or any other folder where any application
and user can create
and modify files without administrator's rights. If RDS is installed into
&laquo;<span class="file">Program Files</span>&raquo; or some folder in &laquo;<span class="file">C</span>&raquo;
root etc. then the update application will not be able to unpack and replace all necessary files.
In this case the user should update RDS manually from the <span class="file">ZIP</span> packages
provided by developers.</p>

<h1>Steps to perform</h1>

<p>1. Download the <a href="updatemodules_eng.html">necessary update files</a> 
in &laquo;<span class="file">upd</span>&raquo; format and save them into the RDS install folder.</p>

<p>By default all downloaded update files are automatically deleted after the successful update.
If those files are needed for updating RDS on different computer they should be backed up manually
before running the updater.</p>

<p class="shift">2. <span class="emph">Close all running RDS instances.</span>
The RDS executable files are locked while running so the updater will not be able to
replace them with newer versions.</p>

<p class="shift">3. Find &laquo;<span class="file">RdsUnpack.exe</span>&raquo; in the RDS
install folder and run it.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="shift">3.1. If the updater's main window is in Russian (or consists of
lines of unreadable characters) then the RDS user interface should be forced to English
language. It could be done by downloading the
<a href="bin/ForceLanguage.ini" download
title="ForceLanguage.ini, 23 b">language switcher file</a>
and placing it into
the RDS install folder where &laquo;RdsUnpack.exe&raquo; is also situated (the updater
has to be restarted for the changes to take place). This file will be automatically deleted next time RDS starts but
the user interface will stay English nevertheless until user changes
it in RDS settings.</p>

<p class="shift">4. The updater main window contains the list of all update files found
in the RDS install folder. Besides the file names the items in this list can contain some remarks
about each file contents. In the bottom left corner
of the window there are two check boxes controlling the installation process:
<ul>
  <li>&laquo;Unpack newer files only&raquo; &ndash;  when checked the files in the update
  package will replace existing RDS files only if the file version in the package
  is newer.</li>
  <li>&laquo;Delete update file after successful unpacking&raquo; &ndash;
  when checked the update file will be automatically deleted upon the successful installation.
  The file will not be deleted if any errors were detected.</li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent">Both check boxes are checked by default and it is recommended not to uncheck them.</p>

<p>The &laquo;Unpack&raquo; button should be pressed to start the installation of the
update files listed.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="shift">5. During the installation the updater window shows the unpack log with
the names of all extracted files. If the update was installed successfully then the log is
concluded with the &laquo;Unpack success&raquo; message and the program automatically exits
in 10 seconds.</p>

</div></div>

<p class="shift">6. If the update was unsuccessful then the log will contain red error messages
and the program window stays on screen. Those errors can have different reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>&laquo;Read error&raquo;, &laquo;Checksum error&raquo; &ndash;
  the downloaded update file is probably corrupted or the <span class="file">&laquo;RdsUnpack.exe&raquo;</span>
  version is too old. In this case the update file in question should be downloaded and installed again.
  If it doesn't help then the RDS developers should be contacted for the new update package and
  the newer version of <span class="file">&laquo;RdsUnpack.exe&raquo;</span>.</li>

  <li>&laquo;Write error&raquo;, &laquo;Unable to set file write time&raquo;,
  &laquo;Unable to copy temporary file&raquo;,
  &laquo;Unable to create temporary file&raquo; &ndash;
  some RDS instances are still running or RDS is installed into the folder without
  full write rights for user and applications. It is necessary to close RDS and repeat the update. If it doesn't
  help then RDS should be re-installed into the different folder (for example, into
  the subfolder of &laquo;<span class="file">My Documents</span>&raquo;) or the updates should be unpacked
  manually from developers' ZIP packages if RDS re-installation is not possible.</li>
</ul>

<p class="shift">7. It is strongly advised to scan the whole RDS installation folder for viruses after
the update.</p>
